These test files are a subset of test inputs made by 6.101 staff for the SAT Solver Lab (from Spring 2025)

| File | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `large_sat_1.json` | `C.json` |
| `huge_sat_1.json` | `I.json` |

`huge_unsolvable.json` was created by modifying `huge_sat_1.json` to include two contraditing unit clauses. Not the best test case (implementation can introduce a unit clause optimization), but works given the limited time constraints for this project.
